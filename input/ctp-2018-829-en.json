        "abstract": "This latest edition of the OECD Model Tax Convention incorporates significant changes that help prevent tax evasion and avoidance, as developed under the OECD/G20 project to address base erosion and profit shifting. The Model assists countries and businesses, by providing a basis for negotiation and application of bilateral tax treaties. It is also useful for settling the most common problems that arise in the field of international double taxation. Today, more than 3000 tax treaties in force around the world are based on the OECD Model. Since 1963, the OECD Model Tax Convention has facilitated bilateral negotiations between countries, and harmonised bilateral conventions for the benefit of both taxpayers and national administrations."
