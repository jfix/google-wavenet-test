        "title": "PISA 2018 Results (Volume III) - What School Life Means for Studentsâ€™ Lives",
        "abstract": "The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) examines what students know in reading, mathematics and science, and what they can do with what they know. It provides the most comprehensive international assessment of learning outcomes for 15-year-olds to date. This third volume focuses on the physical and emotional health of students, the role of teachers and parents in shaping the school climate, and the social life at school. Also examined are indicators of student well-being, and how these relate to the school climate. The study reveals that the disciplinary climate at school improved, in general, between 2009 and 2018, benefitting all types of students. Interestingly, most students believe that ability and intelligence can be developed over time but at least 60% of students in a number of countries stated that intelligence is something that cannot change very much over time. The happiness of 15-year-olds was studied, showing that 90% of students reported being sometimes or always happy, while 6% of students reported always feeling sad. Girls were more likely than boys to report that they frequently feel sad in all countries and economies that participated in PISA 2018."
