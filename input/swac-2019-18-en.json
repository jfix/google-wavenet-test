        "title": "Africa's Urbanisation Dynamics 2020",
        "abstract": "The pace of urbanisation in Africa over the last 60 years is without precedent. In 2015, Kenya had more urban dwellers than the entire continent combined in 1950. Africa will continue to have the fastest urban growth in the world. In the next 30 years, Africa's urban areas will increase by nearly 1 billion people - which is 2.5 times today's urban population in Africa. This report, based on the Africapolis geo-spatial database that covers 7600 urban agglomerations across 50 African countries, provides detailed analyses of major African urbanisation dynamics, placed within historical, environmental, and political contexts."
