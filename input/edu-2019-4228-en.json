        "title": "PISA 2018 Results (Volume I) - What Students Know and Can Do",
        "abstract": "The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) examines what students know in reading, mathematics and science, and what they can do with what they know. It provides the most comprehensive international assessment of learning outcomes for 15-year-olds to date. Findings from this first volume indicate that student performance in reading, math and science remained stable between 2015 and 2018 on average across OECD countries. Students in Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu & Zhejiang (China) and Singapore are by far the highest scorers in reading, science and mathematics. Estonia, Canada, Finland and Ireland are the highest-performing OECD countries in reading. Girls significantly outperformed boys in reading in all countries and economies that participated in PISA and the study found that nearly 1 in 4 students who participated in PISA 2018 has difficulty with basic reading."
