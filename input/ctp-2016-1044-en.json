        "title": "Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations",
        "abstract": "The OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines provide guidance to taxpayers and governments on the application of the “arm’s length principle” for multinational enterprises. This principle represents the international consensus on cross-border transaction valuation between associated enterprises for income tax purposes. Taxpayers need to limit the risks of economic double taxation resulting from a dispute between two countries on the determination of the arm’s length remuneration. Governments need to ensure that the taxable profits of multinational enterprises are not artificially shifted out of their jurisdiction and that the tax base reported in their country reflects the economic activity undertaken therein. The 2017 edition mainly reflects a consolidation of the changes resulting from the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, which helps prevent tax evasion and avoidance."
