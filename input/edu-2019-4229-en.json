        "title": "PISA 2018 Results (Volume II) - Where All Students Can Succeed",
        "abstract": "The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) examines what students know in reading, mathematics and science, and what they can do with what they know. It provides the most comprehensive international assessment of learning outcomes for 15-year-olds to date. This second volume examines gender differences in student performance, and the links between studentsâ€™ socio-economic status and immigrant background. It also examines student performance and well-being. The study found that disadvantage is not destiny: 1 in 10 disadvantaged students and nearly 2 in 10 immigrant students scored in the top 25% of reading in their countries. On the other hand, it revealed that only 7 in 10 high-achieving disadvantaged students, compared to 9 in 10 high-achieving advantaged students expect to complete higher education. The data also show that the world is no longer divided between rich and well-educated nations, and poor and badly educated ones."
